# Political Orientation Classifier For Tweets

## Description & Motivation
According to Pew Research Center, roughly one-quarter of American adults use Twitter, and often it is used to share their views about politics and political issues. Twitter can have a huge impact on the political sphere in the US, and it can be helpful to determine the political orientation of certain tweets to identify the presence of Democratic vs. Republican voice on a social media platform and the issues each party cares the most about.

For this project, we are solving a text / document classification problem, and more specifically, we are creating a generative and a discriminative model to predict the political orientation (‘Democratic’ or ‘Republican’) of a tweet.
